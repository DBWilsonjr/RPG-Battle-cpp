# RPG-Battle-cpp
Precursor to the C# version done as final project

Created April '15.

A very simple RPG fighter. Lets the user create a character and fight a certain number of battles against random foes. ~~Apparently broken by a Visual Studio upgrade somewhere along the way.~~ Disregard, I managed to recover files from before the Visual Studio upgrade.

So now anything that may be broken is on me.
